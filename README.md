# DocuCraft 📄🔐

> **Private, offline document compression & conversion tool — built for personal and sensitive document handling**

---

## ⚠️ Why I Built This

I created **DocuCraft** for my own use to safely compress and convert personal documents such as:

* Aadhaar
* PAN
* Passport
* Certificates
* Legal or identity documents

Uploading such sensitive files to random online converters or compressors is **extremely unsafe** because:

* Files may be stored on unknown servers
* Data may be logged or retained
* Documents can be leaked or misused
* No control over data lifecycle

**DocuCraft solves this by running entirely on your local device.**

Your documents never leave your system.
